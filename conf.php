     <strong>WHAT THIS PLUGIN WILL DO</strong><br/>
      This plugin will delete all ads marked as spam by admin or, if you are using SpamKiller plugin, when the plugin mark the ad as spam,
      NOT when users mark as spam from item page.
      
      <strong>HOW TO SET THE CRON</strong><br/>      
      The cron is pre set to hourly.
      If you whant to change it you need to open the file index.php of the plugin and find //HOOKS FOR CRON at the end of the page then
      uncomment the cron you want.
      There are four types of hooks, the first three are cron releted, the fourth don't use cron, but delete the ad as soon is marked as spam.
      Just uncomment one of them and leave the other three commented to avoid server load.
      You can also leave all four commented and manually delete the spam.
      
      This plugin is usefull if you have installed the plugin SpamKiller.
